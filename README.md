# Personal Website
This is my personal website that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I plan to continue editing this project and add other projects that can be 
accessed through this website. 
Things to do:
change color scheme
create one/two more project, maybe java development or stock api
form validation/send email
nav bar hamburger when mobile
add javascript
